# GravitationalForceCalculator

This C# program calculates the gravitational force between Earth and the International Space Station (ISS) using Newton’s law of universal gravitation. It uses real-world constants and data for the gravitational constant, Earth's mass, ISS mass, and the distance between them.

#### Key Features:
- **Gravitational Constant**: Uses the precise scientific value of \(6.67430 \times 10^{-11}\).
- **Mass of Earth**: Represents the Earth’s mass in kilograms.
- **Mass of ISS**: The mass of the International Space Station in kilograms.
- **Distance Calculation**: Combines the Earth’s radius and the ISS's altitude to compute the distance.
- **Gravitational Force**: Calculates the force of attraction between Earth and the ISS using the formula:
  \[
  F = \frac{G \times m_1 \times m_2}{d^2}
  \]
  where `G` is the gravitational constant, `m_1` is Earth's mass, `m_2` is the ISS mass, and `d` is the distance.


### Application:
- This project simulates the gravitational pull between Earth and an object in orbit, such as the ISS, which is critical for NASA's mission planning, orbital mechanics, and space exploration tasks.

### Output:
The program will display:
1. The gravitational constant.
2. Earth's mass.
3. ISS's mass.
4. The distance between Earth and ISS.
5. The calculated gravitational force in newtons (N). 

This project can be expanded for further use in space research and simulations at NASA, involving more complex orbital bodies and calculations!
